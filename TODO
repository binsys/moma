- Miguel suggested being able to scan your assembly against a live
  Mono install, to see how well your app would run against, say,
  SLED 10.

- Sebastien suggested using the size of the method body to determine
  if a NotImplementedException is the only thing in the method, or if
  it only throws occasionally.  Something to consider if we get reports
  of too many NIE false positives.

- The submission web services is dead simple.  It drops the results 
  unchanged into a directory.  We either need a backend process to make
  these usable, or to do more work in the web service.  A list files and
  retrieve files would be handy.

- We do not currently handle MonoTODO's list on types, only methods.

- Look at ComImportAttribute on classes.  COM Interop is obviously a valid
  "issue".
