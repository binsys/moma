- If you scan something, go back, and scan again, MoMA will reload
  all the definition files.  This could/should be eliminated.

- Miguel suggested being able to scan your assembly against a live
  Mono install, to see how well your app would run against, say,
  SLED 10.

- The definition files should be packed into a zip file, with a data
  file that tells its creation date and the mono version it scans
  against, like "Mono 1.2" or "Mono SVN Head: 10/15/2006".

- Once definition files are in zipped bundles, allow the user to have
  multiple ones installed, and provide a combobox to allow them to
  choose which one to scan against.

- Sebastien suggested using the size of the method body to determine
  if a NotImplementedException is the only thing in the method, or if
  it only throws occasionally.  Something to consider if we get reports
  of too many NIE false positives.

- The submission web services is dead simple.  It drops the results 
  unchanged into a directory.  We either need a backend process to make
  these usable, or to do more work in the web service.  A list files and
  retrieve files would be handy.

- We do not currently handle MonoTODO's list on types, only methods.

- Add the Mono version we scanned against to the submission report.

- Optional comment box for submitted results.

- Don't let them add same assembly twice to scan list.

- Add initobj to calls.

- Remove jpobst.com from app.config.

- Look at ComImportAttribute on classes.  COM Interop is obviously a valid
  "issue".
